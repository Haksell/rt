# rt

I just restarted the project from scratch. `old` branch is more interesting.

## TODO

- [ ] (`Intersection` + `hit`)? (page 83-85)
- [ ] Read `The Ray Tracer Challenge`
- [ ] Remove as many `.clone` as possible
- [ ] Remove `old` branch
- [ ] Complete all `// TODO`
- [ ] Finish subject
- [ ] `iced` with file explorer
- [ ] Save picture (flag + shortcut)
- [ ] `f64` -> `f32` (feature or flag?)
- [ ] `#[inline]` more stuff
- [ ] SIMD
- [ ] Compute shaders with `wgpu`
